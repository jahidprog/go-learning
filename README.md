# Go Learning Repository üß†üöÄ

Welcome to the **Go Learning** repository! This repo contains my practice code and notes as I learn the Go programming language. It's structured around key Go concepts, with real examples and explanations to help reinforce learning. Whether you're learning along with me or just want to browse through different Go topics, this repo is for you!

## üìö Topics Covered

### üîß Functions in Go

Go supports a variety of function types and patterns. In this section, you'll find code examples for each of the following:

1. **Standard / Named Function**  
   Basic declared functions with a name and parameters.

2. **Anonymous Function**  
   Functions without names, often used for short-lived operations.

3. **Function Expression**  
   Assigning a function to a variable for reuse.

4. **Higher-Order / First-Class Function**  
   Functions that take other functions as arguments or return them.

5. **Callback Function**  
   Passing a function to be called at a later point.

6. **Variadic Function**  
   Functions that accept a variable number of arguments.

7. **Init Function**  
   A special function that runs automatically before `main()`; cannot be called manually.

8. **Closure Function**  
   Functions that capture variables from their surrounding scope.

9. **Defer Function**  
   Statements that are deferred until the surrounding function exits.

10. **Receiver Function (Methods)**  
   Functions that are bound to types, like methods in OOP.

11. **IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)**  
   A function that is defined and called immediately.

### üìã Other Core Concepts

- **Array**  
  Fixed-size sequences of elements of the same type.

- **Slice**  
  More flexible and powerful than arrays. They allow dynamic sizing and sharing of underlying arrays.

- **Struct**  
  Custom data types that group related values together.

- **Pointer**  
  Direct memory referencing to allow more control over variable manipulation.
