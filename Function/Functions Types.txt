Function Types

    1. Standard or Named Function: Defined with a name and used multiple times in the code.
    2. Anonymous Function: A function without a name, often used for one-time operations.
    3. Function Expression or Assign Function in Variable: A function that is assigned to a variable for later use.
    4. Higher-order Function or First-class Function: A function that accepts other functions as parameters or returns a function.
    5. Callback Function: A function passed as a parameter to another function and invoked within it.
    6. Variadic Function: A function that can take a variable number of arguments.
    7. Init Function: A special function that is automatically executed before the main function.
    8. Closure Function: A function that captures variables from its surrounding scope.
    9. Defer Function: A function that is deferred and executed just before the surrounding function exits.
    10. Receiver Function: Functions defined on a struct (method).
    11. IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression): An anonymous function that is invoked immediately after its definition.
